### Added

- Added `响应语言与信息缺口规则` to `SKILL.md`, clarifying language following, missing-data handling, and conditional judgment discipline.
- Added `模型使用纪律` to `SKILL.md` so strategic and financial models stay subordinate to the main analysis flow instead of turning into framework dumping.
- Added `路由与参考材料使用` to `SKILL.md` so hosts know when to use `src/router.js` and when to read `references/router-design.md`, `references/examples.md`, and `references/metric-playbook.md`.

### Changed

- Bumped the project version to `1.2.0` across `README.md` and `package.json`.
